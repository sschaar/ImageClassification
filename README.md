# **Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras**

**Tutorial**: [TensorFlow Official Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using TensorFlow and Keras, based on the official TensorFlow tutorial.

## **Setup**

Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.8**, as versions above or below might cause issues when importing TensorFlow and Keras.

### **How to Check Python Version in PyCharm**

1. **Open Project Settings**:  
   Navigate to:  
   `File → Settings → Project: <your project name> → Python Interpreter`.

2. **Select Python 3.8**:  
   From the dropdown list, choose the interpreter with Python 3.8. Make sure it’s linked to your virtual environment.

3. **Confirm and Apply**:  
   Once selected, click **Apply** and **OK** to save your changes and go back to your project.

Now you’re all set to follow the tutorial and work with TensorFlow and Keras!

### **pip install**
`pip install matplotlib numpy pillow tensorflow`

## Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss
**Description**: This chart illustrates the training and validation accuracy over the epochs. The x-axis represents the number of epochs, while the y-axis indicates the accuracy percentage. As shown, the training accuracy increases with each epoch, suggesting that the model is learning. The validation accuracy also improves, indicating that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.
