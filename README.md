# **Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras**

**Tutorial**: [TensorFlow Official Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using TensorFlow and Keras, based on the official TensorFlow tutorial.

## **Setup**

Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.8**, as versions above or below might cause issues when importing TensorFlow and Keras.

### **How to Check Python Version in PyCharm**

1. **Open Project Settings**:  
   Navigate to:  
   `File → Settings → Project: <your project name> → Python Interpreter`.

2. **Select Python 3.8**:  
   From the dropdown list, choose the interpreter with Python 3.8. Make sure it’s linked to your virtual environment.

3. **Confirm and Apply**:  
   Once selected, click **Apply** and **OK** to save your changes and go back to your project.

Now you’re all set to follow the tutorial and work with TensorFlow and Keras!

### **pip install**
`pip install matplotlib numpy pillow tensorflow`
